    <p>After more than a decade of at-times acrimonious back and forth, Ohio’s state historical <br/> society has reached a deal with a country club that operates a golf course on land it owns <br/>that contains ancient Native American earthworks that were built as sacred sites some <br/>2,000 years ago.</p>
    <p>Under the agreement, the society, known as the Ohio History Connection, will acquire the <br/>club’s long-term lease on the property and open the site for full public access, the society <br/>announced on Thursday.</p>
    <p>The financial terms were not disclosed, but the settlement allows both parties—which were <br/>initially millions of dollars apart in their negotiations—to avoid a jury trial to determine the <br/>fair market value of the lease. The Ohio Supreme Court had ruled in 2022 that the historical <br/>society could use eminent domain to buy out the lease from the Moundbuilders Country <br/>Club, which has operated a private golf course atop the Octagon Earthworks since 1910.</p>
    <p>The History Connection, which acquired the land containing the earthworks in 1933 and has <br/>since leased it to the club, will take over the lease on Jan. 1, according to the settlement.</p>
    <p>“Our guiding principles throughout this process have been to enable full public access to the <br/>Octagon Earthworks while ensuring Moundbuilders Country Club receives just compensation <br/>for the value of its lease on the property,” Megan Wood, the executive director and the chief <br/>executive of the History Connection, said in a statement. “And now we have accomplished <br/>those things.”</p>
    <p>The mounds in Newark, about 40 miles east of Columbus, are part of a network of eight <br/>archaeological sites in Ohio, known as the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks, that were <br/>created one basketful of earth at a time, using pointed sticks and clamshell hoes.</p>
    <p>An astronomical and geometric marvel, the mounds’ positions correspond to lunar <br/>movements, and the structures align with points at which the moon rises and sets over the<br/>course of the 18.6-year lunar cycle.</p>

    <p>The earthworks, which helped the Native Americans who built them organize cycles of <br/>planting, hunting and their ritual calendar, were named a UNESCO World Heritage site last <br/>year, a designation that puts them among just over 1,200 such cultural and natural sites <br/>considered to be of “outstanding universal value” to humanity. There are only 26 in the <br/>United States, among them the Grand Canyon, Independence Hall and Hawaii Volcanoes <br/>National Park.</p>
    <p>“The historical, archaeological and astronomical significance of the Octagon Earthworks is <br/>arguably equivalent to Stonehenge or Machu Picchu,” Justice Michael P. Donnelly wrote in <br/>the Ohio Supreme Court’s decision in favor of the state historical society, upholding two <br/>rulings by lower courts.</p>

    <p>But public access was limited to just a handful of days per month, and the country club had <br/>declined offers from the historical society to buy out its lease, which was set to run <br/>through 2078.</p>

    <p>The History Connection sued Moundbuilders in 2018 in an attempt to acquire the lease, after <br/>federal officials told it that securing World Heritage recognition, which brings international <br/>acclaim and legal protection, would be impossible without full public access to the site.</p>

    <p>The club had argued that ending the lease was not necessary to establish public use and that it <br/>had preserved and cared for the mounds.</p>

    <p>After the Ohio Supreme Court ruled in the History Connection’s favor in 2022, the country <br/>club filed a motion for reconsideration that was quickly denied.</p>

    <p>The club had said it was willing to move before the lease was up, but the parties were unable to <br/>agree on the financial terms. At one point the club had sought $12 million in their negotiations, <br/>millions above the historical society’s offer. But negotiations progressed in recent months as a <br/>jury trial to determine the value of the lease loomed.</p>

    <p>David Kratoville, the president of the Moundbuilders Country Club’s board of trustees, said in <br/>an interview that the History Connection had upped its offer to the extent that club would<br/> “have enough money to survive as an entity.”</p>

    <p>The club has reached a memorandum of understanding to buy another property in the area, <br/>the Trout Club, a resort about seven miles away that includes a golf course; dining and <br/>entertainment spaces; and an outdoor pool.</p>

    <p>The resort is open to the public but the Moundbuilders would continue on as a private-<br/>membership entity, Kratoville said.</p>

    <p>“We’re a private membership country club, and that’s our expectation going forward for any <br/>property we acquire,” he said.</p>

    <p>Brent Dewey, the owner of the Trout Club, did not respond to a request for comment, but told <br/>The Newark Advocate, which first reported the deal last week: “We look at it as a win-win for<br/> all sides. They got shoved out of their land. Now they have a home secure.”</p>

    <p>As for whether Moundbuilders would keep its name at a new location, Kratoville said it was<br/> too soon to say.</p>

    <p>“I don’t know what we’ll land on with a name,” he said. “My priority is getting a deal done.”</p>

    <p>The History Connection said it planned to open the Octagon Earthworks to the public in <br/>January, and that the landscaping for the golf course would be removed at a later date.</p>

    <p>“We look forward to partnering with the community to bring vibrant and meaningful visitor <br/>experiences to this remarkable place, and we plan to provide more details after we officially <br/>take possession of the leasehold for the property,” Wood said.</p>

    <p>Glenna Wallace, the chief of the Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma, said full public access <br/>would help to broaden the public’s understanding of her Native American ancestors.</p>

    <p>“I’m ecstatic,” she said in an interview. “I’m trying to imagine how my ancestors must feel <br/>after all these years. I congratulate the Ohio History Connection — it’s been a long, long <br/>journey.</p>

    <p>“I look forward to being able to have people from all over the world come and enjoy that <br/>place,” she added. “I hope we are able to maintain the cultural significance of it, and that <br/>people are able to realize how magnificent and intelligent the ancestors who built these <br/>wonderful earthworks were.”</p>
