            <h3>After more than a decade of at-times acrimonious back and forth, Ohio’s state historical society
                has reached a deal with a country club that operates a golf course on land it owns that contains <a

                    Native American earthworks</a> that were built as sacred sites some 2,000 years ago.
                Under the agreement, the society, known as the Ohio History Connection, will acquire the club’s
                long-term lease on the property and open the site for full public access, the society announced
                on Thursday.</h3>

            <h3>The earthworks, which helped the Native Americans who built them organize cycles of planting,
                hunting and their ritual calendar, <a

                puts them among <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/">just over 1,200 such cultural and natural
                    sites
                    considered to be of “outstanding universal value”</a> to humanity. There are only 26 in the

            <br>
            <h3>The History Connection sued Moundbuilders in 2018 in an attempt to acquire the lease, after federal
                officials told it that securing World Heritage recognition, which brings international acclaim and
                legal protection, would be impossible without full public access to the site.
                <br>
                <br>
                The club had argued that ending the lease was not necessary to establish public use and that it had
                preserved and cared for the mounds.
                <br>
                <br>
                After the Ohio Supreme Court ruled in the History Connection’s favor in 2022, the country club filed
                a motion for reconsideration <a
                    href="https://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/rod/docs/pdf/0/2022/2022-ohio-4586.pdf" target="_blank">that
                    was quickly denied.</a>
            </h3>

            <h3>The club had said it was willing to move before the lease was up, but the parties were unable to
                agree on
                the financial terms. At one point the club had sought $12 million in their negotiations, millions
                above
                the historical society’s offer. But negotiations progressed in recent months as a jury trial to
                determine the value of the lease loomed.
                <br>
                <br>
                David Kratoville, the president of the Moundbuilders Country Club’s board of trustees, said in an
                interview that the History Connection had upped its offer to the extent that club would “have enough
                money to survive as an entity.”
                <br>
                <br>
                The club has reached a memorandum of understanding to buy another property in the area, the Trout
                Club, a
                resort about seven miles away that includes a golf course; dining and entertainment spaces; and an
                outdoor pool.
                <br>
                <br>
                The resort is open to the public but the Moundbuilders would continue on as a private-membership
                entity, Kratoville said.
                <br>
                <br>
                “We’re a private membership country club, and that’s our expectation going forward for any property
                we acquire,” he said.
                <br>
                <br>
                Brent Dewey, the owner of the Trout Club, did not respond to a request for comment, but told The
                Newark Advocate, which first reported the deal last week: “We look at it as a win-win for all sides.
                They
                got shoved out of their land. Now they have a home secure.”
                <br>
                <br>
                As for whether Moundbuilders would keep its name at a new location, Kratoville said it was too soon
                to say.
                <br>
                <br>
                “I don’t know what we’ll land on with a name,” he said. “My priority is getting a deal done.”
                <br>
                <br>
                The History Connection said it planned to open the Octagon Earthworks to the public in January, and
                that
                the landscaping for the golf course would be removed at a later date.
                <br>
                <br>
                “We look forward to partnering with the community to bring vibrant and meaningful visitor experiences
                to this remarkable place, and we plan to provide more details after we officially take possession of
                the leasehold for the property,” Wood said.
                <br>
                <br>
                Glenna Wallace, the chief of the Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma, said full public access would
                help to
                broaden the public’s understanding of her Native American ancestors.
                <br>
                <br>
                “I’m ecstatic,” she said in an interview. “I’m trying to imagine how my ancestors must feel after all
                these years. I congratulate the Ohio History Connection — it’s been a long, long journey.
                <br>
                <br>
                “I look forward to being able to have people from all over the world come and enjoy that place,” she
                added. “I hope we are able to maintain the cultural significance of it, and that people are able to
                realize how magnificent and intelligent the ancestors who built these wonderful earthworks were.”
