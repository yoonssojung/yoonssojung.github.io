            <h1>Planting Seeds Little by Little</h1>
            <br>
            <h2> A garden is a realm of attempts. We plant seeds without knowing when or how they
                will grow. Sometimes,
                there's no sign of progress; other times, sprouts emerge unexpectedly, delighting us. Each day, we
                nurture these seeds, hoping the environment we’ve curated suffices for them to thrive independently.
                This is my garden—a work in progress, continuously enriched by snippets from the vast 'infinite' world
                of the internet. This might be a single flower in the digital expanse and a garden uniquely mine,
                enclosed within a collection of words we call my domain. Is the domain a seed, or is it the garden’s
                boundary? Am I the gardener watering hopes or sowing seeds? </h2>
            <h2> As a person of faith, I have participated in mission trips from local communities to international
                places like Myanmar. Often, such endeavors start with grand aspirations, urging others to embrace
                beliefs unfamiliar to them. However, the forcefulness of these conversions troubled me. From a young
                age, my prayer has been to plant a seed in their hearts—hoping that in time, others will tend it with
                water and sunlight, allowing it to blossom at the perfect moment. This is my vision for my garden: to
                plant seeds without foreseeing what they will become, trusting in their eventual blooming. Every day, I
                plant little by little. Welcome to my garden. </h2>
