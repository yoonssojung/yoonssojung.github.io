            A garden is a realm of attempts. We plant seeds without knowing when or how they will grow. Sometimes,
            there's no sign of progress; other times, sprouts emerge unexpectedly, delighting us. Each day, we nurture
            these seeds, hoping the environment we’ve curated suffices for them to thrive independently. This is my
            garden—a work in progress, continuously enriched by snippets from the vast 'infinite' world of the internet.
            This might be a single flower in the digital expanse and a garden uniquely mine, enclosed within a
            collection of words we call my domain. Is the domain a seed, or is it the garden’s boundary? Am I the
            gardener watering hopes or sowing seeds?
            As a person of faith, I have participated in mission trips from local communities to international places
            like Myanmar. Often, such endeavors start with grand aspirations, urging others to embrace beliefs
            unfamiliar to them. However, the forcefulness of these conversions troubled me. From a young age, my prayer
            has been to plant a seed in their hearts—hoping that in time, others will tend it with water and sunlight,
            allowing it to blossom at the perfect moment. This is my vision for my garden: to plant seeds without
            foreseeing what they will become, trusting in their eventual blooming. Every day, I plant little by little.
            Welcome to my garden.
