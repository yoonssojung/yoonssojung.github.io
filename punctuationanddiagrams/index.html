        <a href="https://oasejournal.nl/en/Issues/48" target="_blank">📕 The diagram is a graphic presentation of the
            course of a phenomenon. It consists of lines, structure, form; it works with reduction, abstraction and
            representation. As a medium the diagram performs a double role: it is a mode of notation, resuming,
            analytic, and reflective; but it also is a model of thought, generating, synthetic and productive. Diagrams
            are a self-evident part of our everyday life with its continuosly growing complexity of information
            flows.</a>
        <p></p>
        <a href="https://oasejournal.nl/en/Issues/48" target="_blank">📕 diagram constitutes a form of visual thinking;
            a thought-image</a>
        <p></p>
        <a href="https://oasejournal.nl/en/Issues/48" target="_blank">📕 Usually the diagram is a chart, graph, drawing
            or figure produced by graphic means and which serves to explain and communicate the facts of a particular
            case. As such, it supplements the technologies of the culture of writing and calculating and thus is an
            integral element in the repertoire of practices with which information is ordered and prepared in order to
            transmit and process it as economically as possible. It is in this property of informational economy that
            lies the value of diagrams for almost all the disciplines as well as the publishing media.</a>

        <a href="https://oasejournal.nl/en/Issues/48" target="_blank">📕 In many cases the findings can only be
            interpreted when the raw data has been organized into the form of diagrams.</a>
        <p></p>
        <a href="https://oasejournal.nl/en/Issues/48" target="_blank">📕 One is therefore obliged to contradict the
            common assumption, according to which diagrams are only accessories—simply derivatory, secondary forms of
            something that has somehow, somewhere already been effectively formulated. No argument for a reduction in
            status can be deduced from the statement that diagrams are simply transcriptions; after all, the
            introduction and use of Arabic numerals were also 'only' a new method of transcription, which we nonetheless
            have to thank for algebra. One cannot ignore the fact that visualisation has traditionally been treated by
            the sciences as secodary; although in theory, its status was that of an auxiliary aid or messengers, in case
            of need, it was indispensable.</a>

        <p>Project breif draft: (chat gpt) This project explores the conceptual and visual intersections between
            punctuation&diagrams with the real world. Diagrams, often serving as graphic representations of phenomena,
            utilize lines, structures, and forms to reduce, abstract, and represent complex ideas. In this project,
            punctuations—symbols that mark pauses and inflections in language—are randomly generated to create a
            foundation for diagrammatic forms. By combining the synthetic, productive nature of diagrams with the
            notational, reflective qualities of punctuation, the project seeks to uncover new ways of interpreting
            information. The resulting visuals become a metaphor for the complexity of information flows in our everyday
            lives, transforming abstract symbols into structured representations. Through reduction and abstraction,
            these diagrams open up possibilities for new modes of thought, presenting a layered reflection on how we
            communicate and process increasingly intricate systems of data.</p>

            in general would have to cover diagrams, maps and models, so that the treatment of symbols and
            transcriptions which comprise designing and planning could be brought into relation with the very different
            treatment of symbols and transcriptions by the sciences in order to produce evidence or manifestness without
            reflecting on its share in the production of knowledge.</a>

Similarity between three sign languages was 28.57%, 32.33% between KSL and ASL, 63.35% between KSL and JSL, 38.43% between JSL and ASL. The results of this study showed that KSL and JSL are very similar.</a>
        <a href="">sign languages have evolved naturally, just like spoken languages. There is no “universal” sign language that is understood by all deaf communities around the world.</a>
