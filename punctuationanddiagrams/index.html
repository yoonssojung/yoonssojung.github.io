        <a href="https://oasejournal.nl/en/Issues/48" target="_blank">📕 The diagram is a graphic presentation of the course of a phenomenon. It consists of lines, structure, form; it works with reduction, abstraction and representation. As a medium the diagram performs a double role: it is a mode of notation, resuming, analytic, and reflective; but it also is a model of thought, generating, synthetic and productive. Diagrams are a self-evident part of our everyday life with its continuosly growing complexity of information flows.</a><p></p>
        <a href="https://oasejournal.nl/en/Issues/48" target="_blank">📕 diagram constitutes a form of visual thinking; a thought-image</a><p></p>
        <a href="https://oasejournal.nl/en/Issues/48" target="_blank">📕 Usually the diagram is a chart, graph, drawing or figure produced by graphic means and which serves to explain and communicate the facts of a particular case. As such, it supplements the technologies of the culture of writing and calculating and thus is an integral element in the repertoire of practices with which information is ordered and prepared in order to transmit and process it as economically as possible. It is in this property of informational economy that lies the value of diagrams for almost all the disciplines as well as the publishing media.</a><p></p>

                    <a href="https://oasejournal.nl/en/Issues/48" target="_blank">📕 One is therefore obliged to contradict the common assumption, according to which diagrams are only accessories—simply derivatory, secondary forms of something that has somehow, somewhere already been effectively formulated. No argument for a reduction in status can be deduced from the statement that diagrams are simply transcriptions; after all, the introduction and use of Arabic numerals were also 'only' a new method of transcription, which we nonetheless have to thank for algebra. One cannot ignore the fact that visualisation has traditionally been treated by the sciences as secodary; although in theory, its status was that of an auxiliary aid or messengers, in case of need, it was indispensable.</a><p></p>

                <p>Project breif draft: (chat gpt) This project explores the conceptual and visual intersections between punctuation&diagrams with the real world. Diagrams, often serving as graphic representations of phenomena, utilize lines, structures, and forms to reduce, abstract, and represent complex ideas. In this project, punctuations—symbols that mark pauses and inflections in language—are randomly generated to create a foundation for diagrammatic forms. By combining the synthetic, productive nature of diagrams with the notational, reflective qualities of punctuation, the project seeks to uncover new ways of interpreting information. The resulting visuals become a metaphor for the complexity of information flows in our everyday lives, transforming abstract symbols into structured representations. Through reduction and abstraction, these diagrams open up possibilities for new modes of thought, presenting a layered reflection on how we communicate and process increasingly intricate systems of data.</p>
